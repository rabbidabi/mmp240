    <h1>Resume</h1>
    
    <p> I am a college student studying graphic design and I enjoy photography and telling stories with pictures. I have experience working as a vendor at Crossmark since January 2026 where I talk to customers, set up products, keep shelves neat, and manage my time while working on my own. I also work as a freelance photographer since 2024 where I take photos of people and events, edit them using Lightroom and Photoshop, and make sure clients get the pictures they want. I have skills in graphic design, layouts, photo editing, using computers, talking with people, managing my time, and playing drums and piano </p>
