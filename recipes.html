    <p> How to Make a Cheeseburger: A Step-by-Step Description
A cheeseburger is more than just a sandwich — it’s a balance of textures, flavors, and temperatures. Here’s a clear, step-by-step description of how to make one from scratch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the Ingredients</li>

Beef patty: Use freshly ground beef with about 80% lean meat and 20% fat for juiciness.


Cheese: Cheddar, American, Swiss, or your favorite melting cheese.


Bun: Soft burger buns, lightly sliced in half.


Toppings: Lettuce, tomato slices, onions, pickles.


Condiments: Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or a special sauce.


<li>Shape and Season the Patty<li>

Form the ground beef into a round patty slightly larger than the bun (it will shrink during cooking).


Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides.


<li>Cook the Patty<li>

Heat a skillet, grill, or griddle over medium-high heat.


Place the patty on the hot surface and cook for about 3–4 minutes per side for medium doneness.


In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top and cover the pan or close the grill lid to melt it.


<li>Toast the Buns<li>

Lightly butter the cut sides of the buns.


Place them face-down on the skillet or grill for 30–60 seconds until golden brown.


<li>Assemble the Cheeseburger<li>

Spread condiments on the bottom bun.


Add lettuce and tomato for freshness.


Place the hot, cheesy patty on top.


Add onions, pickles, or any extra toppings you like.


Finish with the top bun.


<li>Serve and Enjoy<li>
Serve immediately while the cheese is still melted and the patty is juicy. Pair with fries, chips, or a salad for a complete meal.


A great cheeseburger is all about timing — the cheese should melt perfectly, the bun should be warm, and the toppings should stay crisp.
